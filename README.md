## Design of Site

### Initial idea

The main purpose of this site was to create a front end that would display collections from MongoDB. I decided to create a fake basketball team called the Bridgend Eagles (my local town). The Database would display news articles, players and fixtures of the team. An admin account would have permissions to update, delete and create new records. It would be fully responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile and would have a connection to the emailJS API to allow users to contact the site owner.

### Wireframes

To create the wireframes for this site I used the balsamiq cloud service. This allowed me to create a more basic wireframe. This was helpful as I have found in the past having a more complex and detailed wireframe to be quite restricting. 

<details><summary>Home Page Wireframe (news) - Mobile</summary><img src="docs/wireframes/Fixtures Page Mobile.png"></details><br>

<details><summary>Home Page Wireframe (news) - Tablet</summary><img src="docs/wireframes/Home Page Tablet.png"></details><br>

<details><summary>Contact Page Wireframe - Desktop</summary><img src="docs/wireframes/Contact Page Desktop.png"></details><br>

### Site Layout

The Site will have four main pages and these will be the news page, fixtures page, players page and contact page. 
These pages will be accessed via a nav bar at the top of the page. 
There will be two other sub pages; a registration page and a sign in page and one more link in the nav bar where users can sign out.

The design of the site will be achieved using the materialize framework.

#### Navigation Bar
The first thing that a user will see when they enter the site is the navigation bar. This will be made consistent across the whole site lending cohesion and familiarity and allowing all pages to be accessed without using the back button. It consists of a bar containing the navigation links and the logo for the site. The logo acts as an additional link for the index/news page. The nav bar is fully responsive and collapses into a hamburger icon with a pop out navigation list on any device tablet sized or smaller.

<details><summary>Navigation Bar</summary><img src="docs/features/Nav_bar.png"></details><br>

#### Footer-

The footer of the page is another section which remains consistent throught the site. This informs the user that they have reached the bottom of the site and there is no more content. I have also included some useful information in the footer, such as a repeat of the team name, the training times of the team and links to social media sites.

<details><summary>Footer</summary><img src="docs/features/Footer.png"></details><br>

#### News Page

The news page contains a series of cards styled from the Materialize framework that displays the news articles created by the site admin. The information on the cards is input through a front end form that the admin can access by clicking the 'add article' button. Once the form has been filled out the admin can submit the form which will then insert that information into a MongoDB collection which is then displayed on the news page in a new card. 

The admin also has access to an edit article button where they can change any part of the article posted aside from the date which will always be the current date. Furthermore there is a delete article button on the edit article page which will completely remove the object from the MongoDB collection. 

On both the add article and edit article page there is a cancel link which returns the admin to the display articles page.

<details><summary>News Page- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/display_articles.gif"></details><br>

<details><summary>Add Article Page- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/add_article.gif"></details><br>

<details><summary>Edit Article- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/edit_article.gif"></details><br>

<details><summary>Delete Article- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/delete_article.gif"></details><br>

#### Fixtures Page

The fixtures page contains an accordion styled list from the Materialize framework that display the fixtures created by the site admin. The information in the accordion is input through a front end form that the admin can access by clicking the 'add fixture' button. Once the form has been filled out the admin can submit the form which will then insert that information into a MongoDB collection which is then displayed on the fixture page as a new section on the accordion list. The accordion list is sorted by the game number.

The admin also has access to an edit fixture button where they can change any part of the article posted. Furthermore there is a delete fixture button on the edit article page which will completely remove the object from the MongoDB collection. 

On both the add fixture and edit fixture page there is a cancel link which returns the admin to the display articles page.

<details><summary>Fixtures Page- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/display_fixtures.gif"></details><br>

<details><summary>Add Fixture Page- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/add_fixture.gif"></details><br>

<details><summary>Edit Fixture- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/edit_fixture.gif"></details><br>

<details><summary>Delete Fixture- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/delete_fixture.gif"></details><br>

#### Players Page

The players page contains a series of cards styled from the Materialize framework that displays the players Profile photo and information (The cards can be clicked on to display further relevant atatistics) created by the site admin. The information on the cards is input through a front end form that the admin can access by clicking the 'add player' button. The profile photo has a default value which inputs a placeholder image until the site admin can provide an appropriate link for an image (I have used imgur in this instance however any image hosting site should suffice). Once the form has been filled out the admin can submit the form which will then insert that information into a MongoDB collection which is then displayed on the players page in a new card. 

The admin also has access to an edit player button where they can change any part of the player posted. Furthermore there is a delete player button on the edit player page which will completely remove the object from the MongoDB collection. 

On both the add player and edit player page there is a cancel link which returns the admin to the display players page.

As a protection measure only registered users can view the Players page to protect personal information, as part of a further release any attempt to register will have to be approved by the site admin.

<details><summary>Edit Player- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/edit_player.gif"></details><br>

<details><summary>Delete Player- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/delete_player.gif"></details><br>

#### Contact Page

The contact Page is for users to get in contact with the site owner. There is a form to be filled out where they provide first name, last name, email address and then a message to the site owner. Upon pressing submit an alert pops up to inform them that the message has been sent and the form will then reset.

This page uses the emailJS API to facilitate sending the form as an email.

<details><summary>Contact Page- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/contact_form.gif"></details><br>

#### SignIn and Registration Pages

These two pages are very similar in structure. They both contain a form for the user to fill out. They provide a username and password and click the submit button. The registration page inserts the new user to the collection. The sign in page checks the collection for an existing user and initiates a new user session if the user is found. 

<details><summary>SignIn- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/sign_in.gif"></details><br>

<details><summary>Registration- Gif</summary><img src="docs/features/registration.gif"></details><br>

#### Sign Out Link

This is a link in the nav bar only visible once signed in. Once clicked it will end the current user session.

### Colour Choices

The colours for this website were decided on from the materialize colour pallet classes. The colours I decided on were the Blue-Lighten 1 selection.
I chose this as it was in keeping with the usual colour scheme for many Bridgend based sports teams in real life such as the Bridgend Ravens rugby team.<br><br>
<img src="docs/Color of site.png">

### Fonts
The font used for the site is the "Exo" font as this had quite a bold and easy to read style whilst also being curved, thus giving the website an approachable feel.

21. I want to receive emails from users that fill out the relevant form.

| **Feature Used** | **User Action** | **Expectation** | **Result** |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Contact Us Page | User can access a contact page where a form will be present to fill out | The user can provide their Name, E-mail and questions which upon submission will be emailed to site owner via EmailJS client | Works as expected |


## Bug Squashing

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
|---------|---------|
When using the delete functionality for fixtures.html after selecting to delete on the confirmation modal a different collapsible selection would open and then get deleted as that was the active ID. | I am not sure why this happens as there is no trigger being clicked on I can only assume it is an interaction between the modal and collapsible classes of Materialize. Therefore in this case I have moved the delete fixture button to the edit_fixture.html page as this is only accessible to the admin and bypasses the bug.

## Deployment

### Project Creation
I used the [CI MongoDB Code Anywhere Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-mongo-template) to create this project and used Code Anywhere as my IDE.

From the CI Mongo template above the steps to create this project were:
1. Click on 'Use this template' and select 'Create a new repository'
2. Enter your chosen repo name
3. Click 'Create Repository'
4. From the new GitHub repo copy the the page URL
5. Open Code Anywhere and navigate to the 'workspaces' page
6. Click on 'New Workspace'
7. Paste the GitHub repo URL in to the 'Repository URL' box
8. Click 'Create'


### Deployment to Heroku

To deploy to Heroku:
1. In Code Anywhere CLI from the main directory run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` to create/update a requirements.txt file containing project dependencies.
2. In Code Anywhere CLI from the main directory run `echo web: python app.py > Procfile` to create a Procfile. Check that the file contains the text 'web: python app.py' and delete any blank lines at the bottom.
3. Push the 2 new files to the GitHub repository
4. Login to Heroku, select 'Create New App', create a unique name for the app and select your nearest region. Click 'Create App'
5. Navigate to the Deploy tab on Heroku dashboard and select Github, search for your repository by name and click 'connect'.
6. Navigate to 'settings', click reveal config vars and input the the following:

IP
MONGO_DBNAME
MONGO_URI
SECRET_KEY
OMDB_API_KEY
PORT

7. Go back to the Deploy tab and 'Enable Automatic Deploys'
8. Click deploy branch
9. Once build is complete click on 'View' to open app in the browser
